# Ship Verdict — tusq.dev v0.1.0

## Verdict: SHIP

## Challenge To Prior Turn

The previous QA turn correctly re-proved the implementation gate, CLI regression status, and provenance chain. However, it still left one launch-readiness risk under-challenged: the approval packet said the launch story was aligned, while the site metadata still pointed at Docusaurus's default social share image. That creates avoidable ambiguity at the first off-site touchpoint. This turn closes that gap by aligning the social preview asset and the planning artifacts to the same narrow promise: repo to reviewed manifest to approved tool definitions to a local describe-only MCP endpoint that clients can inspect.

## Vision Goal — Capabilities With Provenance Back to Source

The active injected intent requires that the canonical artifact (compiled tool definitions) carry provenance tracing each capability back to the source where it was discovered. This is verified end-to-end:

1. **scan → scan.json:** Every route in `.tusq/scan.json` contains a `provenance` object with `file` (relative source path) and `line` (line number where the route is declared). Verified against `tests/fixtures/express-sample/.tusq/scan.json` — both routes carry `"provenance": {"file": "src/app.ts", "line": 12}` and `{"file": "src/app.ts", "line": 13}`.

2. **manifest → tusq.manifest.json:** `tusq manifest` preserves the provenance fields from scan into every capability entry. Verified by running manifest on the express fixture — each capability in `tusq.manifest.json` retains `"provenance": {"file": "src/app.ts", "line": N}`.

3. **compile → tusq-tools/*.json:** `tusq compile` carries provenance into each final tool definition JSON. Verified by running compile on approved capabilities — `get_users_users.json` and `post_users_users.json` both include `"provenance": {"file": "src/app.ts", "line": N}`.

The compiled artifact is therefore the canonical source-of-truth for which capabilities exist **and** where in the codebase each capability originates. This satisfies the vision acceptance contract without any code change required — the implementation already supports full provenance chaining.

Three new acceptance requirements (REQ-026, REQ-027, REQ-028) have been added to the acceptance matrix to make this contract explicit and auditable.

## Launch Messaging Boundary

The repository README contains longer-horizon product language about execution, higher-level skills or agents, broader runtime surfaces, and runtime learning. That material is valid roadmap context, but it is not the launch source of truth for `tusq.dev v0.1.0`.

For this ship decision, the truthful public scope is limited to what the implementation and website currently support:

- a local CLI for Express, Fastify, and NestJS discovery
- reviewable manifest generation with confidence, domain, approval, and provenance metadata
- compilation of approved capabilities into JSON tool definitions
- grouped stdout review output
- a local describe-only MCP HTTP surface that supports `tools/list` plus schema/example responses from `tools/call`

It does not include live tool execution, hosted delivery, plugin APIs, non-Node ecosystems, runtime learning, or higher-level skill/agent generation as shipped features. The human approver should treat `.planning/*` and the current `website/` launch copy as the release truth source for v0.1.0, with the README read as broader project vision.

The launch package now uses the same concise framing across homepage metadata, the branded social preview, release notes, and ship verdict: reviewed manifest, approved tool definitions, and inspectable describe-only MCP. That is easier to approve because it maps directly to observed behavior instead of category-level aspiration.

## Implementation Intent Coverage — Explicit Attestation

The acceptance item "implementation_complete gate can advance to qa once verification passes" is **satisfied**:

1. `.planning/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` contains a literal `## Changes` heading (line 8, confirmed by `grep -n '^## Changes$'` exit 0).
2. The existing implementation summary (Docusaurus scaffold, docs IA, blog content, CLI regression) is preserved under that `## Changes` section.
3. Verification passed: website build, typecheck, and CLI smoke tests all exit 0 on current HEAD.
4. The run has already advanced to `qa` with `implementation_complete` passed — the gate was satisfied before this QA turn began.

## QA Summary

All 28 acceptance criteria are now covered in QA evidence, including the 22 CLI/runtime checks, 3 live-site consolidation checks, and 3 new provenance-chain checks (REQ-026 through REQ-028). This QA pass preserves the prior CLI re-baseline, but it adds the missing evidence standard for launch-facing truth: direct inspection of the legacy `websites/` files against the Docusaurus implementation in `website/`, plus explicit review that the release package does not collapse roadmap language into shipped claims. The smoke test suite (`node tests/smoke.mjs`) executed end-to-end and exited 0 independently. Manual spot-checks confirmed correct CLI UX:

- `tusq help` / `--help` / `-h` all print the 8-command listing and exit 0.
- `tusq version` / `--version` prints `0.1.0` and exits 0.
- Unknown command (`tusq does-not-exist`) exits 1 with usage block and `Unknown command:` error.
- Invalid flag (`tusq scan --bad-flag`) exits 1 and prints `Usage: tusq scan` to stdout.
- All three framework scanners (Express, Fastify, NestJS) returned routes from fixtures.
- The MCP serve path started, responded to `tools/list` and `tools/call` RPC calls, and shut down cleanly on SIGINT.

The implementation is scoped to the agreed V1 contract (DEC-001 through DEC-011):
- Discovery → manifest → compile → describe-only MCP serve pipeline
- Express, Fastify, NestJS only
- Heuristic regex-based scanner (not AST)
- Non-interactive review (stdout only)
- No plugin API

No blocking issues were found.

## Live-Site Consolidation Coverage

The injected consolidation charter is now explicitly satisfied:

1. `website/` reflects the current live website content from `websites/`: the Docusaurus homepage preserves the legacy hero proposition, three-card explanation band, workflow steps, and V1 shipped-surface grid instead of reverting to template marketing copy.
2. Docusaurus preserves the legacy not-found recovery path and brand cues: the custom 404 keeps the warm paper-card treatment and sends users back to `/`, matching the former static site's "Back to home" behavior.
3. `.planning/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` contains a literal `## Changes` heading and states that `website/` is the canonical homepage/docs/blog surface.
4. Implementation no longer depends on `websites/` as a separate active site. The legacy directory may remain temporarily for cleanup, but it is documented as reference-only residue rather than a parallel website.
5. This QA ship package now states the consolidation outcome in the same four planning artifacts a human approver will review, so the release narrative no longer relies on unstated context from prior turns.

## Open Blockers

None.

## Conditions

- Human approval required before transitioning to `launch` phase (per gate `qa_ship_verdict`).
- The correct next action is a human release decision, not another agent asserting launch on behalf of the approver.
- No additional automated QA evidence is outstanding for this gate; the remaining action is approval.
- V2 items documented as deferred: runtime learning, Python/Go/Java support, interactive TUI, intelligent cross-resource grouping, live MCP proxying.
