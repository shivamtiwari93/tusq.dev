## Key Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Content drift from product truth | Overclaiming damages credibility | M7 audit against MESSAGING.md; PM review before merge |
| Docusaurus version/config issues | Build failures | Pin to latest stable 3.x; use default plugins only |
| Brand inconsistency with current site | Jarring visual transition | Migrate exact colors/fonts from existing CSS |
| Docs become stale as CLI evolves | User confusion | Docs are derived from spec; updating spec triggers doc update |
