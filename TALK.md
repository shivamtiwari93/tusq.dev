## Turn 5bcc56d8 — pm (planning)

- **Status:** needs_human
- **Summary:** Filled all planning artifacts with concrete V1 scope: CLI tool scanning Express/Fastify/NestJS codebases, producing capability manifests, compiling tools, and serving via local MCP. Awaiting human approval to open planning gate.
- **Decision DEC-001:** V1 is scoped to the discovery-manifest-compile-serve pipeline for 3 Node.js frameworks only. All 12 vision domains are deferred to V2+.
- **Decision DEC-002:** MCP serve is describe-only in V1 — no live API proxying.
- **Decision DEC-003:** Capability grouping starts as 1:1 route-to-capability mapping. Intelligent grouping deferred.
- **Decision DEC-004:** No plugin API in V1. Framework support is hardcoded for Express, Fastify, NestJS.
- **Decision DEC-005:** TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem only in V1. Python, Go, Java are V2+.
- **Proposed next:** human

## Turn b41e7d88 — pm (planning)

- **Status:** completed
- **Summary:** Fixed 4 contradictions in planning artifacts: tusq review is non-interactive (not interactive TUI), manifest requires explicit prior scan (no implicit scan), approval mechanism documented (manual JSON edit), and added missing error case for no scan data.
- **Decision DEC-006:** tusq review is non-interactive in V1 — prints summary to stdout only. Users approve capabilities by editing tusq.manifest.json directly. Interactive TUI deferred to V1.1.
- **Decision DEC-007:** tusq manifest requires an explicit prior tusq scan — no implicit scan fallback in V1.
- **Proposed next:** human

## Turn 9f5d0072 — pm (planning)

- **Status:** needs_human
- **Summary:** Fixed scan data persistence gap (added .tusq/scan.json file contract) and clarified --format json on scan. All planning artifacts are internally consistent and ready for human signoff.
- **Decision DEC-008:** Scan data persists to .tusq/scan.json as an internal file contract between tusq scan and tusq manifest.
- **Proposed next:** human
